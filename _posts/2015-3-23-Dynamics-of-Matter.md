1.Responsiveness of Materials

As stated in the first part of this essay, matter interacts based on different vibrational frequencies. Smart
materials are being conceived according to studies of perceptive and responsive abilities of material.
Polymers have been exploited also for medical applications. Ferrofluid (fig.16), an oily liquid made of nanoscale
ferromagnetic particles, suspended in a carrier fluid that reacts to magnetic fields, has several applications in
our daily life thanks to its properties. It is for example used to seal spinning drive shafts in hard disks. Lately it
has been applied in the experimental cure for tumors, thanks to the ability of the nanoparticles to convert electromagnetic
energy into thermal energy or heat, that could kill the desired cells without damaging surrounding
tissue.
The emerging field of biomimetics has given rise to new technologies created from biologically inspired engineering
at both the macro scale and nanoscale levels.
2.molecular manipulation
Biomimicry is a practice based on the examination of nature, its models, systems, processes, and elements to
emulate, or take inspiration from, in order to solve human challenges. Janine Benjus declared that a holistic
picture of natureâ€™s systems can be directly applied to our human systems.
By looking at sharks, scientists have been able to replicate dermal denticles in swimsuits that allowed olympic
swimmers to go faster. According to biomimc logic, researchers are trying to uncover key design principles that
nature uses to build living things. Created by a process of hierarchical self-assembly, the process that allows
molecules to make cells, cells to make tissues, and tissues to give rise to whole organisms, living materials can
grow, move, learn, and self-organize. They are responsive, adaptive, programmable, self-healing, stable, and
engineered to reproduce specific actions. Hence natural materials are also uniquely multifunctional as they can
serve simultaneously as mechanical frameworks, chemical factories, light-conducting conduits, electric field
generators, energy harvesters, and information processing networks.
Revolutionary steps are taken at the Laboratory Organovo based in San Diego (fig.17), where biophysicst Dr.
Gabor Forgacs and his team are working on creating functional human tissues using three-dimensional bioprinting
technology. The printed material comes from two ink-jet cartridges. One is filled with cells, the other
with a hydrogel, which acts as a scaffold. First the hydrogel structure is printed, then the cells onto it. Within
24-48 hours the cells fuse around the structure to form a usable organ.
