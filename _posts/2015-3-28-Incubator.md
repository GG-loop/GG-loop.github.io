In this post I'm collecting all the development of the incubator.
Inspired by the research of Hans Jenny (and Ernst Chaldni before of course), I want to conduct experiment on bacteria cultures exposed to continuous sound emissions, because of the geometrical analogy between forms in music and forms in nature, and try to manipulate that.

The update on the design process: I wanted something to be fully equipped as displayed in the sketch below.
Besides the inner properties I imagined it to be assembled in a multitude of incubators so I thougt about a cellular aggregation. Inspired by a platonic solid, this shape is meant to be replicate infinetely.

Unrolled surface for prototying. Note that, being symmetrical on a diagonal axis, it has also identical faces.

Below the idea of how the incubator will look like.
A speaker and ultrasound transducers array will be integrated. A LED system and a camera to monitor the growth evolution.

I quickly tested the power of them with a Britney Spears' song. You can shoot sound at one precise point on a long distance

and what the possibilities are:
