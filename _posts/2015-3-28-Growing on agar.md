title: What's growing on the agar?
---

Every bacterium or algae or fungi has its own specific conditions in which to grow. 
Food is important for us as much as nutrients are really important for them!
A balanced reciepe is necessary to prepare their living habitat. 
That is called medium and 
<a href="http://biohackacademy.github.io/biofactory/annex/cultivation-media/">here</a> it's our list of cultivation media

Their shape when it grows is really fascinating. Their growth follows specific geometric patterns. 
The more they grow the more complex they become.
Let's take a look at them!

But why does it happen? What's the logic behind this circular geometric growth?
Let'c check them on the microscope to find out more!
