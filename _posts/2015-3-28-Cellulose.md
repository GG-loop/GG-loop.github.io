Kombucha in glycerole medium after 3 weeks. The medium is more transparent even though the growth seems to be slower.
A contamination happened but the 2 species cohabit in the medium.

I am turning upsidedown the kombucha so the contamination doesn't have oxygen anymore, to see if it stops the growth.

The assumption was right and after 5 weeks the contamination almost disappeared
