1.Music and Geometry

Music and Geometry are more closely linked than apparent . The interconnected aspects of the two sciences,
since the beginning of theoretical speculation, have been fundamental for architectural composition.
The theory of “Number” by Pythagoras revealed fixed relations between simple numbers and musical consonances.
These proportions were later used to “elevate” architecture. The theory of “Number” was part of a
larger theoretical complex, according to which divine perfection manifests itself in all things through the rules
of harmony. Pythagoras and Plato laid the foundations of this theory: the phenomenical world is linked to
the metaphysical one through the reflection of the “Musica universalis” (fig.1) upon “the things of the Earth”.
Pythagoras related the length of a rope to the pitch of a sound and consequently used the monochord to explain
numerical ratios according to the melodic range that they form. Plato illustrated the “Musica universalis”
in “The Timaeus” and through the Myth of Er in “The Republic”, confirming the Pythagorean thought that the
soul of man coincides with the soul of the world, both similar in structure and harmony. The considerations on
the value of Pythagoras’ “Number” and Plato’s geometric solids (fig.2) form the starting point for most of the
later theories on the subject, in particular the Renaissance Neoplatonism: Vitruvius’ architecture, Dantes’ poetry
and Boethius’ music. Later, Alberti found in harmonious proportions the link between architecture and music
(fig.3), as did Palladio (using the new harmonic ratios of the musical consonances introduced by Zarlino),
reaching up to N.F. Blondel (late seventeenth century) [ 1 ].
The harmonic consonances affect the human mind, and through perception of the same harmonies man unites
with God according to the “Doctrine of the affections”. The leading proponent of this theory is Vincenzo Galilei,
the father of GaIileo, music theorist of great importance that goes back to the ancient philosophy of Aristotle
and Aristoxenus.
