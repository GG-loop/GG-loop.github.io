In this post I'm collecting all the development of the incubator.
Inspired by the research of Hans Jenny (and Ernst Chaldni of course), because of the geometrical analogy between forms in music and forms in nature, I want to conduct experiment on bacteria cultures exposed to continuous sound emissions.

Below the idea of how the incubator will look like.
A speaker and ultrasound transducers array will be integrated.
