<i> "Architecture and music have always been my main interests.
During my personal investigation of design approaches I came to realize how close these two forms of expression are.
Main concepts in one field, assume significant meaning within the other: form, structure, rhythm, tone and so on. Music, as
sequences of sound and silence, embodies my vision of Architecture: harmonic sequences of full and empty, closed volumes
and open spaces, light and shadow, evolving in a continuous loop.
Both fields have the capacity to stimulate all five senses in a Copernican way, the human being the center point." 
Giacomo Garziano </i>
